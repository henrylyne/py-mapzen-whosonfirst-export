# py-mapzen-gazetteer-export

Export tools for the Who's On First

## Install

```
sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --process-dependency-links .
```

### Caveats

This won't work without `--process-dependency-links` so I am not sure yet what happens when it gets removed from pip 1.6...

## IMPORTANT

This library is provided as-is, right now. It lacks proper
documentation which will probably make it hard for you to use unless
you are willing to poke and around and investigate things on your
own.
